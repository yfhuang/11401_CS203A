# Study Note: Linked List

## Description
Linked List: A linked list is a sequence of nodes stored in non-contiguously memory. Each node contains a value field and a pointer field that links to the next node. Traversal is sequential O(n), but insertion or deletion (given a node) is O(1).

## Abstract Data Type

A linked list can be represented as an Abstract Data Type (ADT) with the following operations:

- **Create**: Initialize an empty linked list.
- **Insert**: Add a new node with a given value at a specific position.
- **Delete**: Remove a node at a specific position.
- **Search**: Find a node containing a specific value.
- **Traverse**: Visit each node in the linked list sequentially.
- **Update**: Modify the value of a node at a specific position.

These operations allow for dynamic memory usage and efficient insertion/deletion compared to arrays.
