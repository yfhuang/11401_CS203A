# Study Note: Hash Table

## Description
- A data structure that stores key-value pairs using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets. 
- This allows for average constant-time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. 
- Hash tables handle collisions through techniques like chaining or open addressing, making them ideal for fast data retrieval (average O(1) time).​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
