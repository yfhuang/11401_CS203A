# Data Structures & Algorithms: Animation

## Background
This project aims to leverage AI tools to create interactive web animations that help students better understand fundamental data structures and algorithms. By visualizing complex concepts through dynamic, step-by-step animations, we provide an engaging learning experience that makes abstract algorithmic processes more intuitive and accessible.

## Animation
- Graph DFS
    - Animation: [DFS](dfs_dfs_anim.html), [DFS with Recursion](dfs_stack_anim.html), [DFS with Recursion Displayed in the Stack](dfs_recursive_callback_frames.html)
    - Prompts for ChatGPT
        - `In teaching data structures, is it possible to use AI to generate animations that demonstrate each step of an operation—for example, an animation of DFS on an undirected graph?`
        - `Generate a self-contained HTML file (no libraries) that animates iterative DFS on an undirected graph, showing visited nodes, stack, DFS tree edges, and step-by-step narration.`
        - `Generate a self-contained HTML file (no libraries) that animates recursive DFS with a visible recursive call stack (and it also highlights tree edges, parent edges, and back edges in an undirected graph).`
        - `Generate a self-contained HTML file (no libraries) that animates recursive DFS and displays a visible recursive call stack in a dedicated panel (and it also highlights tree edges, parent edges, and back edges in an undirected graph).`
