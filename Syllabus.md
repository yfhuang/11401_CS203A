- **Late Submission:** Late submissions will not be accepted.
- **Accountability:**
    - **Progress:** Stay on track with materials, complete assignments on time, and seek help early if needed.
    - **Ownership:** All work must reflect your own effort and understanding.
    - **Technical:** Keep backups and ensure submissions are complete before deadlines.
    - **Communication:** Inform the instructor promptly in case of issues with valid reasons.
    - **Collaboration:** Contribute fairly and responsibly in group work.

## Prerequisites
- Proficiency in programming with C or C++ (knowledge of Java or Python is also acceptable)
- Basic understanding of version control systems such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
