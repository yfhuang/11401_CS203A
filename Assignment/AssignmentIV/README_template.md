# Homework Assignment IV: Hash Function Design & Observation (C/C++ Version)

## My Hash Function
### Integer Keys 
- Formula / pseudocode:
  ```text
  [Your implementation here]
  ```
- Rationale: [Explain your design choices and how they minimize collisions.]

### Non-integer Keys
- Formula / pseudocode:
  ```text
  [Your implementation here]
  ```
- Rationale: [Explain your approach and its effectiveness for non-integer keys.]

## Experimental Setup
- Table sizes tested (m): 10, 11, 37
- Test dataset:
  - Integers: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60
  - Strings: "cat", "dog", "bat", "cow", "ant", "owl", "bee", "hen", "pig", "fox"
- Compiler: GCC and G++
- Standard: C23 and C++23

## Results
| Table Size (m) | Index Sequence         | Observation              |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| 10             | 1, 2, 3, 4, ...        | Pattern repeats every 10 |
| 11             | 10, 0, 1, 2, ...       | More uniform             |
| 37             | 20, 21, 22, 23, ...    | Near-uniform             |

## Analysis
- Prime vs non-prime `m`: Prime table sizes generally result in better distribution and fewer collisions.
- Patterns or collisions: Non-prime table sizes tend to produce repetitive patterns, leading to more collisions.
- Improvements: Use a prime table size and a well-designed hash function to enhance distribution.

## Reflection
1. Designing hash functions requires balancing simplicity and effectiveness to minimize collisions.
2. Table size significantly impacts the uniformity of the hash distribution, with prime sizes performing better.
3. The design using a prime table size and a linear transformation formula produced the most uniform index sequence.
